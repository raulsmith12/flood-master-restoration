                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is a common issue that often remains unnoticed until it has already caused significant damage. Kearns, with its unique climate and occasional humidity, can create an ideal environment for mold growth. From unsightly stains on walls and ceilings to a musty odor permeating the air, the signs of mold damage can manifest in various ways.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Beyond the visible impact, mold poses health risks to occupants. Respiratory issues, allergies, and other health complications can arise from exposure to mold spores. Addressing mold damage promptly is not just about preserving the structural integrity of your home but also safeguarding the health of your family.</p>
