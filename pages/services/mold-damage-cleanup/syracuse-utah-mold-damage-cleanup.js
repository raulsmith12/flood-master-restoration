                                                <p className="text-white">Mold, often undetected until it&rsquo;s too late, can silently invade your home, thriving in damp and dark spaces. From the notorious black mold to less conspicuous varieties, these microscopic intruders can wreak havoc on your property, causing structural damage and, more alarmingly, triggering health issues.</p>
                                                <h3 className="text-white text-center display-5">Structural Threats: Unseen but Significant</h3>
                                                <p className="text-white">Mold can compromise the integrity of your home&rsquo;s structure. It thrives in moist environments, feeding on organic materials such as wood, drywall, and insulation. Over time, this can lead to weakened structures, affecting the safety and stability of your home.</p>

Prolonged exposure to mold spores can trigger respiratory issues, allergies, and other health complications.
