                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is more than just a nuisance; it&rsquo;s a potential health hazard that can wreak havoc on your property and your well-being. Mold thrives in damp and humid environments, making it a common issue after water damage incidents. When left untreated, mold can spread rapidly, compromising the structural integrity of your home and exacerbating respiratory problems such as asthma and allergies. Moreover, certain types of mold, such as black mold, release toxic spores that can cause severe health complications.</p>
