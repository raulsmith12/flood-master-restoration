                                                <h3 className="text-white text-center display-5">The Hidden Threat of Mold</h3>
                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is more than just an unsightly presence in your home; it&rsquo;s a potential health hazard and can compromise the structural integrity of your property. In Pleasant View&rsquo;s climate, with its varied weather conditions, mold can easily find its way into your home, whether through leaks, high humidity, or poor ventilation.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Mold spores are microscopic and can be found in the air both indoors and outdoors. When they land on damp surfaces, they can quickly multiply, forming colonies that can grow and spread throughout your home. The most common indoor molds include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and the notorious Stachybotrys chartarum, commonly referred to as &ldquo;black mold.&rdquo;</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Exposure to mold can cause a range of health issues, especially for those with allergies, asthma, or weakened immune systems. Symptoms can vary, including nasal stuffiness, throat irritation, coughing, wheezing, skin irritation, and eye irritation. Prolonged exposure to mold can lead to more severe respiratory problems.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Moreover, mold can damage your property by compromising its structural integrity. It feeds on organic materials such as wood and drywall, leading to decay, warping, and in severe cases, weakening the structural components of your home.</p>
