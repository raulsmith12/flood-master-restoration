                                                <h3 className="text-white text-center display-5">Understanding the Menace of Mold</h3>
                                                <p className="text-white">Mold, a type of fungus, thrives in environments with high moisture levels, making it a common issue in Millcreek homes, particularly those susceptible to water damage or poor ventilation. From the moment spores find a hospitable environment, they can rapidly colonize various surfaces, including walls, ceilings, floors, and even furnishings. The consequences extend beyond mere discoloration and musty odors; mold can trigger respiratory issues, exacerbate allergies, and compromise indoor air quality, posing serious health risks, especially to vulnerable individuals.</p>
