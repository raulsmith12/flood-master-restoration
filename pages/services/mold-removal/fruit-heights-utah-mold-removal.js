                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is more than just an unsightly inconvenience; it poses significant health risks and can compromise the safety of your home. In humid climates like Fruit Heights, mold thrives in damp, poorly ventilated areas such as basements, attics, and bathrooms. Once it takes hold, mold can spread rapidly, releasing harmful spores into the air. Prolonged exposure to mold can trigger respiratory problems, allergies, and even exacerbate existing health conditions. Moreover, mold can weaken the structure of your home, leading to costly repairs and structural damage.</p>
