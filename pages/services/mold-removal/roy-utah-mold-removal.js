                                                <p className="text-white">Utah&rsquo;s unique climate, characterized by dry summers and cold winters, creates an environment conducive to mold growth. Mold thrives in damp or humid conditions, making basements, attics, and bathrooms particularly vulnerable. The combination of temperature fluctuations and occasional heavy rainfall provides an ideal breeding ground for mold spores.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Mold not only poses risks to your property but can also have serious implications for your health. Common health issues associated with mold exposure include respiratory problems, allergies, and skin irritation. Identifying and addressing mold problems promptly is crucial to maintaining a healthy indoor environment.</p>
