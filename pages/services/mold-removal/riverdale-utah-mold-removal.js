                                                <p className="text-white">Mold, often concealed in the nooks and crannies of our homes, is a silent intruder that poses serious threats to both property and health. In Riverdale&rsquo;s unique climate, with its blend of warm summers and cold winters, the conditions are ripe for mold growth. Whether it&rsquo;s hidden behind walls, thriving in damp basements, or silently spreading through ventilation systems, mold can compromise the structural integrity of your home and lead to a range of health issues.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Recognizing the signs of a mold infestation is the first step towards reclaiming a healthy living space. Common indicators include musty odors, visible mold growth, persistent allergy symptoms, and discoloration of walls or ceilings. Ignoring these red flags can lead to more significant problems over time, making it crucial to address mold issues promptly and effectively.</p>
