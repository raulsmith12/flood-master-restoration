                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is a silent intruder that often goes unnoticed until it&rsquo;s too late. In the arid climate of Salt Lake City, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the potential threat that mold poses. However, the reality is that mold can thrive in various environments, especially when moisture, warmth, and organic matter converge. Whether it&rsquo;s a hidden leak, inadequate ventilation, or the aftermath of a flood, mold can take root and spread rapidly, compromising the air quality and structural integrity of your property.</p>
