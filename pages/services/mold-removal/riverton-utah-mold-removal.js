                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is a type of fungus that thrives in damp and humid environments, making Utah&rsquo;s climate particularly conducive to its growth. From basements to attics, bathrooms to kitchens, mold can colonize virtually any surface, spreading rapidly if left unchecked. Beyond the unsightly appearance and musty odor it brings, mold can trigger allergies, respiratory problems, and other health complications, especially for vulnerable individuals.</p>
