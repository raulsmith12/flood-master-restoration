                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is a stealthy intruder that can thrive in various environments, often undetected until it becomes a serious issue. With its preference for damp and dark spaces, mold can flourish in basements, attics, bathrooms, and even within the walls of your home. Its microscopic spores can travel through the air, settling and establishing colonies wherever moisture is present.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">Not only can mold compromise the structural integrity of your property by damaging walls, ceilings, and floors, but it can also pose significant health risks. Mold exposure has been linked to respiratory issues, allergies, skin irritation, and more. Recognizing the signs of mold growth is crucial for the well-being of your family and the longevity of your home.</p>
