                                                <p className="text-white">Mold, a type of fungus, thrives in damp and humid environments, making North Ogden&rsquo;s climate an ideal breeding ground. From unseen water leaks to inadequate ventilation, various factors contribute to mold growth within homes. Once mold takes hold, it spreads rapidly, releasing spores into the air, which can trigger allergies, respiratory issues, and even exacerbate existing health conditions. Moreover, mold not only damages structural integrity but also jeopardizes indoor air quality, impacting the overall well-being of occupants.</p>
