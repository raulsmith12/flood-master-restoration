                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is more than just an unsightly nuisance; it poses serious risks to both property and health. In addition to causing structural damage to buildings, mold can trigger allergies, respiratory issues, and other health complications. Moreover, certain types of mold, such as black mold, produce toxic substances that can be harmful when ingested or inhaled.</p>
                                                <p className="text-white">In Magna, where the climate can be conducive to mold growth, it&rsquo;s essential to address any signs of mold infestation promptly.
