                                                <p className="text-white">Mold is a silent intruder, often making its presence felt long before it becomes visible. It thrives in damp and humid conditions, commonly found in basements, attics, bathrooms, and other moisture-prone areas.

Moreover, mold can compromise the structural integrity of your home, leading to significant damage and costly repairs.</p>
