Common symptoms include respiratory issues, allergic reactions, skin rashes, and even more severe conditions in individuals with compromised immune systems. Children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions are particularly vulnerable.</li>
                                                    <li className="text-white"><strong className="text-white">Structural Damage:</strong>&nbsp;Mold growth can weaken the structural integrity of your property.
